# Stock Price Prediction

## Overview
This project is designed to predict stock prices using machine learning techniques. The notebook explores various models and methodologies to forecast future stock prices based on historical data.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature engineering for stock price prediction
- Machine Learning models for prediction
- Performance evaluation of models

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- TensorFlow/Keras (if deep learning models are included)

## Installation
To set up the environment, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn tensorflow
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Load the dataset and preprocess the data.
3. Perform exploratory data analysis.
4. Train the machine learning models.
5. Evaluate the model's performance.
6. Make predictions on new stock data.

## Dataset
Ensure that you have the stock price dataset in CSV format. Modify the notebook to load your dataset accordingly.

## Model Training
- Various machine learning models are tested for accuracy.
- Feature selection and hyperparameter tuning are performed to optimize performance.
- The best-performing model is used for prediction.

## Results
The evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and accuracy scores are analyzed to determine the model's effectiveness.

## Future Improvements
- Implement deep learning models such as LSTM for time-series forecasting.
- Incorporate external factors like news sentiment analysis for better prediction.
- Optimize hyperparameters further for improved accuracy.
